# ZLibCompressorDecompressor
A demo of how to use zlib for compressing and decompressing an image.

It is based on this codeguru post: https://www.codeguru.com/cplusplus/zlib-add-industrial-strength-compression-to-your-c-c-apps/

To get started, you must clone the repository, open the .sln in Visual Studio and add the enclosed zlib folder I got from here https://www.bruot.org/hp/libraries/ to the project.
(You know the drill; including the headers and linking to the library!)

I made this as a reference, because it seems like I might have to use zlib more often in the future.
